# Node API Overview

> Low-level, chain-agnostic access to blockchains (RPC, WebSockets, tracing, debugging)

> For the complete documentation index, see [llms.txt](/docs/llms.txt).

The **Node API** is our implementation of the standard JSON-RPC interface (as defined by Ethereum) and compatible equivalents for non-EVM chains (e.g., Solana, Bitcoin). Use it when you want direct, low-level reads and writes against a blockchain.

> Looking for higher-level building blocks?
> For indexed, enriched queries use the **[Data APIs](/docs/reference/data-overview)**.
> For account-abstraction and smart-wallet flows use the **[Wallet APIs](/docs/wallets)**.

## TL;DR

* We support multiple chains. Most use the **same EVM JSON-RPC methods**; a few have **chain-specific methods**.
* You can browse each chain's RPC, quirks, and connection details in **[Chains](/docs/reference/chain-apis-overview)**.
* We also offer **additional products** that sit alongside core RPC: **WebSockets**, **Yellowstone gRPC**, and **Trace/Debug** with **varying chain support**.

# Chain APIs

Chain APIs are the per-chain RPC surfaces exposed through the Node API.

* **EVM chains:** Share the standard `eth_*` interface (e.g., `eth_call`, `eth_getLogs`, `eth_sendRawTransaction`).
* **Non-EVM chains:** Provide compatible JSON-RPC or equivalent endpoints, plus **special methods** where the protocol differs.

👉 Head to **[Chains](/docs/reference/chain-apis-overview)** for:

* Full method lists and examples per chain
* Endpoint URLs and connection details
* Notes on chain-specific behavior and limits

# When to use the Node API

Use the Node API when you need the **raw, low-level interface** to:

* Send and simulate transactions
* Read onchain state (balances, storage, view calls)
* Filter/poll logs and events
* Build tools close to node-level logic

> For enriched, historical, or cross-entity queries, prefer **[Data APIs](/docs/reference/data-overview)**.
> For smart account flows, prefer **[Wallet APIs](/docs/wallets)**.
